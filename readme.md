## The motivators of this project
I have found something is wrong with traditional education system:
- [what good is learning if I don't remember it?](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1055665.pdf)
- active learning vs passing learning / scout young
- [spatial web browsing](https://maggieappleton.com/spatial-web)

## Inspirations
- Board of [OrgPad](https://orgpad.info/)
- Github's colorful issue tags and the ability to search by language, date, ...
- `Saved Messages` in telegram (or any other messanger)
- Pinterest style (Masonry) layout
